# ASCII_STL_to_IMG_WIP
This is a C# WIP that can open and read the ASCII raw data of STL files and converts them into an image.\r\n
THE FILE LOCATIONS ARE CURRENTLY BLANK!\r\n
Please fill them in with your own file locations, meaning an ASCII encoded STL (I have provided one), and the exact location of where you want your image saved.
That includes naming the file, i.e. C:\Users\Name\Documents\FILE.bmp or whatever you wish the output to be.
